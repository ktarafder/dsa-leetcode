# DSA LeetCode Adventures

*Because nothing says “I’ve got free time!” like wrestling LeetCode problems for hours on end.*

## Welcome

Hi there! I’ve decided to scale the great mountain known as **LeetCode**. Here, you’ll find a collection of Data Structures & Algorithms solutions that I’ve whipped together in the pursuit of code mastery… or total meltdown—whichever comes first.

If you like to see code break down in comedic fashion, you’re in the right place. Grab your laptop (and maybe some tissues) and join me on this wacky journey of logic, syntax, and the occasional existential crisis. 

## What You’ll Find Here

- **A Growing Arsenal of Problems:** Each folder in this repo represents a LeetCode question. I’ll add new solutions as I tackle them.
- **Python Goodness:** My primary weapons of choice is Python, though I’ll occasionally sprinkle in other languages just to keep things interesting. I'm planning on doing some questions in Go.
- **Commentary & Notes:** I like leaving short explanations so I can figure out what on earth was running through my mind. It’s cheaper than therapy.

## Why I’m Doing This to Myself

- **Interview Prep:** Gotta impress those future employers, right?
- **Master the Fundamentals:** Nothing like a bit of BFS, DFS, or O(N log N) to stay sharp.
- **Data & Algorithm Wizardry:** I love to talk programming for hours on end. The only thing better than talking about code is actually coding... or free pizza.
